If Knew size in advance then go for Array because performance wise Array is best compare to Collection .

In Collection default size would be "10". once the size is completely filled then another size will be allocated which is double the previous size.
  eg:
     In collection having a 1 lack element which was completely filled.Then i'm inserting 1 element in that collection object ** for Inserting 1 element another 
     will created size of 2 lack**.
