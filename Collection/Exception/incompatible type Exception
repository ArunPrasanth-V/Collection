For Example :
             In an int array if we represent double or other data type then it shows compile time error which is incompatible.
             eg:
              int []a={12.5};
             
             TO overcome this problem we need one that can hold both homogenous and heterogenous element.
              ->Either we can go 
                         i)Object Array unlike specfic type like int , double.
                         ii)COllection.
